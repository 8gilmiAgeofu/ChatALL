The DVD captures the energy and excitement of the live show, with each guitarist playing a set of their own songs, followed by a joint performance of Neil Young's "Rockin' in the Free World", Jimi Hendrix's "Little Wing" and "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)". The DVD also includes some special features, such as a Fretcam option that allows the viewer to see the guitarists' fingers up close, a "Lightning Plot" overview that shows the stage setup and lighting effects, biographies of the performers and a tour book with photos and credits.
 
The DVD has received positive reviews from critics and fans alike, who praised the technical prowess and musical diversity of the three guitarists. The DVD also achieved commercial success, reaching the top 10 of several music DVD charts around the world and earning platinum certification in the United States. G3 Live In Denver 2003 is a must-have for any guitar lover or rock fan who wants to witness a historic night of music by three masters of their craft.
  
The DVD also showcases the different personalities and approaches of the three guitarists. Joe Satriani is the laid-back and friendly mentor, who plays with a smooth and melodic style that blends rock, blues and jazz influences. He also sings and plays harmonica on some of his songs, adding some variety to his set. Steve Vai is the eccentric and creative innovator, who plays with a virtuosic and expressive style that incorporates various effects, techniques and sounds. He also brings out a special guitar with a heart-shaped hole and a triple-neck guitar for some of his songs, demonstrating his flair for the unusual. Yngwie Malmsteen is the arrogant and flamboyant shredder, who plays with a fast and furious style that draws from classical music and metal. He also displays his ego and attitude by throwing his guitar around, smashing his pickups and spraying water on the audience.
 
The DVD has received some criticism from some fans and reviewers, who felt that Yngwie Malmsteen did not fit well with the other two guitarists, and that he was too loud, selfish and repetitive in his playing. Some also complained that the DVD did not include the full sets of each guitarist, and that some songs were cut or edited. Others pointed out that the DVD had some technical flaws, such as missing audio for some of the performers, poor lighting and camera work, and low quality sound. However, these issues did not detract from the overall enjoyment and appreciation of the DVD for most viewers.
 
G3 Live In Denver 2003 is a testament to the power and beauty of guitar music, and a tribute to three legends who have inspired generations of guitarists with their talent and passion. It is a rare opportunity to see them share the stage and play their hearts out for their fans. It is a DVD that every guitar fan should own and watch repeatedly.
